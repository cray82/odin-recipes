        <h2>Cheesecake made with avocados and lime</h2>
        <p1>This dessert is inspired my mexican food incorporating lime and avocados to make a Cheesecake. The green color may look funky but it the taste is delish. This dish does require you have access to an ice cream maker</p1>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li> 3/4 cups white sugar</li>
            <li> 1 & 1/2 ripe avocados, peeled and pitted</li>
            <li> 2 (3 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li> 1/2 cup fresh lime juice</li>
            <li> 1 (8 inch) prepared graham cracker crust</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat cream in a small saucepan until small bubbles appear around edges. Remove from heat and stir sugar into cream until it dissolves. Transfer to a medium bowl and allow to cool.</li>

            <li>Combine avocado and cream cheese in a food processor and blend until smooth. Add lime juice and process until smooth; whisk into the cooled cream mixture.</li>

            <li>Fill an ice cream maker with the avocado mixture, and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions for making ice cream.</li>

            <li>Spoon avocado mixture into the prepared pie crust; smooth surface with a spatula. Freeze until solid, at least 2 hours. Let cheesecake sit at room temperature until slightly softened yet firm enough to slice before serving, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
