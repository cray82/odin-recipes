        <h1>Hawaiian Meatballs Recipe</h1>
        <img src="./food-pics/hawaiian-meatballs.jpg">
        <h2>Meatballs in a sweet, tangy sauce</h2>
        <p1>The sweetness of the pinapples balances out the savory flavour of the meat and more savory ingredients. Best served with rice, juice will flavor the rice and add more filling to the meal.</p1>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 lb. ground beef</li>
            <li> 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li> 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li> 1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li> 1 (8 ounce) can pineapple chunks, juice reserved</li>
            <li> 1/3 cup water, as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Sauce</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> 1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            <li> 1/4 cup white vinegar</li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li> 1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix together ground beef, ginger, garlic powder, and pepper until well combined. Form into 1 1/2-inch meatballs.</li>
            <li>Saute meatballs in a large frying pan over medium-high heat until browned, about 10 minutes. Remove meatballs to a plate, reserving the pan drippings.</li>
            <li>While the meatballs are cooking, pour juice from the canned pineapple into a liquid measuring cup and add enough water to make 1 cup. Mix brown sugar and cornstarch in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Add pineapple juice and brown sugar mixtures to the warm pan drippings. Add vinegar and soy sauce and bring to a boil. Cook until sauce thickens, 2 to 3 minutes. Add meatballs, pineapple chunks, and green pepper. Simmer until meatballs are no longer pink inside, about 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
